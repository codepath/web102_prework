# WEB102 Prework - Sea Monster Games

Submitted by: Melody Nguyen

Sea Monster Games is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: 18 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [X] The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
* [X] The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
* [X] The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding
* [X] The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
I changed some of the functionality, for example, the mouse cursor to change only if the clicking event will cause some change and the regular pointer when it does not. Additionally, I changed the background shadow to be of the actual gamecard instead of the container to add a better aesthetic. Moreover, I added a white shadow to the "unfunded", "funded", and "all games" buttons with it being bolded when hovered. I also made the game card italicized if the user hovers over it to catch their attention of what they are looking at.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

A challenge I faced was familiarizing myself with the syntax and logic. I struggled to understand how the javascript communicating with the HTML file and DOM manipulation. I additionally struggled to word the question I needed answered, which extended the research I did with general answers. The most challenging part for me was initally understanding how to use VisualCode and Github and DOM manipulation.
